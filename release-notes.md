### Migration from version 2.6.0 to 3.0.0

In SDK version 3.0.0, if you are are handling payment methods selection in your page, the process has been updated.
`checkout.create(containerId, mopId)` now returns a string representing the `componentId` of the payment payment method.

```Javascript
// - `container` can be either a String containing a HTML id or a HTMLElement
// - `mop` can be any element of the `mopsList` sent in `onReady` callback
const componentId =  await checkout.create(container, mop.id);
```

The returned componentId is crucial for further interactions with the component. When a payment method is selected, you should ensure its component is displayed. Instead of using `AmadeusCheckout.selectMop(mopId)`, you now call `checkout.selectMopComponent(selectedComponentId)` to get the right status updates. If another payment method is chosen, you can simply call `AmadeusCheckout.selectMopComponent(componentId)` again.

Version 3.0.0 also introduce support for multiple Methods of Payment via the helper function `AmadeusCheckout.selectMopComponents(mopSelections)` described below:

Parameters:

- `mopSelections`: Array. Array of objects, containing the following properties:
  - `componentId`: String.  Id of the payment method component.
  - `amount`: String. Amount used for the selected payment method. This property is optional (full amount considered if not present). We strongly advise to always provide it in case of multiple method of payments.

It is important to note that a debounce timer of 300ms has been added to the `selectMopComponents` function to reduce server calls.

Lastly, the `onChange` callback is now obsolete and should be replaced by `onPaymentMethodsChange`.
